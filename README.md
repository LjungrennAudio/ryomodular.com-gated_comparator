 another unevolved idea with immense potential but so far fallow

2408302354

yet another iea from 'the archive of mysteries' - this time a near complete module in that it's a fully routed and tested prottotyppe for a comparator woth interesting bonus feature set. but... someone didnt realise this was effectively the identical core setup of the proposed'magic window' that has eveloved into the project known as 'jacob's ladder'. as a result this is yet again another that  is only likely to see light of day as part of a greater whole ad neer to be released in it's og state.

nevertheless a very fany w indow comparator which goes on to trigger a myriad of other actions when triggered is an absolte sho in for the acob's ladder project and a big boost indeed!
