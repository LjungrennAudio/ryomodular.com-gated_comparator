<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="37008" --><p>Whenever I read the April 
issue of any magazine, vintage or contemporary, lurking in my mind is whether it 
is an attempt at an April Fools "gotcha." The article title is usually the first 
clue that the author is trying to punk me at least provides a sporting chance. Take 
for instance this "Analog Logic" piece in the April 1972 edition of <em>Popular 
Electronics</em>. It could easily be a hoax, so I proceeded cautiously. It turns 
out to be completely legitimate. James Hannas provides a few examples of how analog 
circuits can be used to perform mathematical functions that are easily handled by 
logic circuits. Of course prior to the introduction of readily available, inexpensive 
digital integrated circuits only a few years earlier, all those mathematical functions 
were performed by analog circuits, so this was nothing new to most readers. If you 
have never researched the capabilities of both analog and mechanical computers, 
it would be worth your time; you will be amazed. One example that always impresses 
me is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_gun_fire-control_system" target="_top">electromechanical systems</a> that pointed and stabilized the massive 
gun turrets on battleships during World War&nbsp;II.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered how some complex calculators can do so many operations 
at such high speed and accuracy? The answer is in the use of linear and non-linear 
integrated circuits that are basically quite simple in theory. Most of the circuits 
involve an operational amplifier - a very high-gain linear amplifier that inverts 
the input signal. </p>
<p>When input and feedback resistors are connected to the op amp as shown in Fig.&nbsp;1, 
the amplifier tries to maintain its input as close to zero as possible. The higher 
the gain, the lower the offset or error voltage. To do this, the amplifier must 
cause a current through the feedback and input so that the voltage drop across the 
input resistor is equal to the input voltage. The input swing is equal to the input 
voltage times R<em>f</em>/R<em>i</em>. A graphical analogy of the amplifier is shown 
in Fig.&nbsp;2. </p>
<p>Using the same circuit, but with additional input resistors, the amplifier can 
be made into an adder. The sum of the voltages can also be multiplied by a constant 
by adjusting the input resistors. </p>
<p>Nonlinear functions, such as squaring, can be performed by the diode shunt matrix 
shown in Fig.&nbsp;3. By adjusting the feedback resistors, any type of curve with 
increasing magnitude can be formed. A logarithmic, or decreasing, curve will result 
when the diode matrix is used as a feedback instead of a shunt matrix. </p>
<p>The most common squaring circuit is shown in Fig.&nbsp;4. The numbers on the 
op amps indicate the multiplier constants. By adding one quarter of the sums of 
A-B and A+B, the result is the product of A and B. </p>
<p>Division is shown in Fig.&nbsp;5. Here an op amp is supplied feedback by a multiplier 
circuit which is controlled by B. As B increases, the output decreases. </p>
<p>There are also operational amplifiers and multipliers which are binary-to-analog 
and analog-to-binary converters. These are basically resistor networks and amplifiers. 
By combining analog circuits with binary bit storage, switching and readouts, a 
compact calculator can be designed. </p>
